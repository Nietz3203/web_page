# Welcome to my Webpage!

## Hi, there! I'm Nietz.
I'm a college student who makes some games as a hobby.
Since it's just a hobby, progress is practically nonexistent. But when I feel like it, or when my creativity explodes, I make something.

## So... it's like this.

```
from principles_of_world import time
from god_dice import random

while(live):
    time.sleep(random.uniform(0, 10^10000))
    idea = get_idea()
    if idea.Entertainability >= 80:
        work = deploying_work(idea)
        if work.quality >= 1:
            upload_work(work)
        me.hp -= 2000
        me.age += 1
    else:
        sleep()
```

## Oh, I forgot the most important part.
